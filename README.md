Each mod has a ReadMe file to give a quick overview of its features. It's formatted for github markdown, so it's better to read them directly in github, by clicking on each mod above, or in the Highlights section below. This way you get the hyperlinks and the images.   

We are still early in A17 experimental phase, I won't be porting my full A16 sdx mod collection until A17 stable hits. For now, I will most likely make XML-only modlets.  

# Installation
The modlets are XML-only, so you can simply place them in the Mods folder of your A17 installation.  
I don't think A17 currently supports automatically reading from Localization files that are inside mod folders. You can simply copy the content of the Localization.txt file present in each modlet, to the Game's Localization.txt file.
